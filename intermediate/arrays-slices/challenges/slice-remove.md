# Slices and Arrays: Challenges

## Challenge

Take on this challenge: Slices in Go do not come with a built-in method to remove an element. Implementing this functionality requires custom logic.

## Question

Implement a function that removes a specified element from a slice and ensure that it works correctly.

## Checkpoints

For a more comprehensive approach, consider the following checkpoints:

1. **Check**: Verify if the specified element exists in the slice before attempting to remove it.
2. **Remove**: Implement the logic to remove the element from the slice.
3. **Freefall**: Test your solution with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected in different scenarios.

## Hint

To check your solution, you can compare your code with the example implementation provided in the `challenges/slice-remove.go` file.

## Reminder

Remember, learning new concepts does not mean you will master everything right away. Take your time to understand and implement these functionalities effectively.
